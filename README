General
----------
Main upstream repo is at https://bitbucket.org/nanonyme/nanobot/overview so 
please file bugs there.
Github repo https://github.com/nanonyme/nanobot is synced with it regurarly.

Installing
----------
Highly recommended twisted from svn 
(svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk), it's more stable 
than the release versions when this was written. exocet is available from 
https://launchpad.net/exocet.

Plugins documentation must clearly tell additional requirements. If you feel 
this isn't the case, please file a bug.

Testing
---------
nose recommended for running tests. Tests require mock and new unittest 
library which is available for Python 2.6 as unittest2.
