General
----------
Main upstream repo is at https://bitbucket.org/nanonyme/nanobot/overview so 
please file bugs there.
Github repo https://github.com/nanonyme/nanobot is synced with it regurarly.

Installing
----------
Highly recommended twisted from svn 
(svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk), it's more stable 
than the release versions when this was written.

Plugins documentation must clearly tell additional requirements. If you feel 
this isn't the case, please file a bug.

Testing
---------
Trial recommended for running tests since it comes with twisted. Some tests 
require mock and all tests are expected to be written with twisted trial.
